Report on Alumni Association and Software
2019.04.17, 2023.01.09 Geoffrey Gordon Ashbrook


Introduction
This report outlines suggested practical goals and solutions to facilitate meeting the combined needs of alumni, current students, future students, private-sector/industry partners, public sector partners, and the school, with a focus on having a front-end / interface for Alumni connecting with and contributing to the larger ecosystem.

In April of 2019 I did not know about https://foreverbuffsnetwork.com/ , so much of this may already be there.


Goal Set 1: General Abstract Macro Goals [a recommendation]
1.1  Student success should be the main focus.
Focus on the (overall and long term) goal of educating current students, which may indirectly include future-students and helping current students to connect to employment after school or further education after their current program. 

'Success' in academics, employment, and other areas may have various measures and goals:
- contributing to society, planet, the solar system
- resilience to future changes
- extending academic study (more graduate school attendance)
- better employment after school
- cutting edge research
- health in mind, body, and lifestyle; a well rounded education
- contributing to the local-regional economy (becoming an employer)
- political and international-cooperation goals
- etc. 

On goals of assisting Future-Students:
- helping with goals of gender parity
- alumni interested in grants or scholarships
- helping to coach students so they are prepared to do well



1.2  Utilize crowd-sourcing crowd-funding to build a support network directed at helping students (and alumni):
- study skills
- helping students to get a solid start and hit the ground running
- course and major recommendations
- student projects & research
- student entrepreneurship
- mentoring
- finding sponsors for student work outside of the school (companies, government grants, other organizations)
- later employment 
- later higher education
- support for academic multi-student organization: study groups, clubs, 
- general volunteering by retired alumni, helping students, faculty, administrators, etc.
- alumni helping alumni to organize support for students (one member of the alumni may an idea for a project to help students but cannot carry it out alone or without advice, a team of alumni could help)


Goal Set 2: Contribute & Connect: Goals/Requests/Hopes of Alumni

2.1  Contribute:
- to contribute to the goal of serving students
- to contribute to programs, research, faculty, etc.

2.2  Connect:
- to be connected to (developments, programs, events, news, etc.)
- to be connected with other alumni	
- to be connected with students
- to be connected to the larger school community (staff, etc) and industries
- to projects that can be joined or supported

2.3 On-Going Training: (...experimental option...)
- As technology changes rapidly, continued training in new developments may become increasingly necessary for alumni. It may be possible for largely alumni-coordinated activities that do not require many extra resources directly from the school to be a way for a school to encourage lifelong-learning and support the continued fitness and long term employment success of graduated-students. 












Example Uses & Functions: 

Build a Alumni Application (either a web-page and/or software for iOS, Android) 

1. Alumni-Profile for Contribution & Support Network Areas:
(For Students, for alumni, for CU, etc.)
	- where you are
	- time of availability if known
	- what you are knowledgeable about, skills, experience,
        etc.
	- wishlist (project to contribute to (or create),
        assistance needed, )

2. Projects:
	- like github, maybe literally using github or whatever platform each person uses. The alumni-network can simply link-to the project wherever it lives.

2. Content and Publishing: News, magazine, Narrative & Discussion, Outreach:
	- get/write weekly or current news briefs
	- get/write a "magazine" with more in depth articles
	- get/write alumni blogs
	- making it easier for to connect with alumni in specific contexts:
	e.g. if in an alumni's self-designed profile they express an interest in donation, that may be a vital resource for CU staff and students organizing and prioritizing calls for donations. 
	And the same for any areas where the person states what they would like to help with, this can be searched by the school when looking for people who want to help with that thing. 


3. Connect: 
	- other alumni in general 
		- alumni in the area you currently live
	- stay in touch with your (past) classmates in general
     - business collaboration and networking 
        (making use of existing tools like linked-in) 
(see below, this may ideally be a system that leverages existing connection platforms such as linkedin and forever-buffs, but which can add additional connective functionality.



4. Contribute:
	Monetary Donations:
- help direct donations to specific programs, projects and departments
		- more general donations

	Event Volunteering:
		- help screen prospective students (maybe?)
- contribute to building and maintaining this open-source software (maybe called Campus Connect).
- Helping with administrative work that is overtaxing staff.
- Brownbags
- contribute to documentation and student resources
- 
Advising and Remote volunteering:

	etc.

5. Collaboration Tools:
(Tools that will help the Alumni to follow through.)
	- buddy system for goals and follow through with other 
        alumni 

6. Coordinate, Create & Manage Projects and Events:
- a kickstarter type framework for joining projects that help students. or alumni or students can propose ideas, which other people will or won't sign on to.

Student projects, either research or entrepreneurial, may need or be helped by volunteers or donors, a cu-alumni-network-kickstarter type platform where people can suggest anything from volunteering to equipment to contact-recommendations for a project may be helpful.
	e.g.
	- volunteering to screen interview new students
	- get togethers, sports events
	- fundraisers:
		- & Research
		- student/alumni entrepreneurship
	- cultural event planning: concerts
	- build Wikis

7. Emergencies: in the case of natural disaster, if students, faculty buildings (whatever) are in danger, nearby or capable alumni can be contacted with a help request.
	- emergency mesh-network function

8. Occupational:
	- resume-contact networking like Linkedin
	- helping graduates to find a job
- helping students start companies and develop products while still enrolled at school
	- helping people with jobs adjust to new areas
	- resume/CV writing, editing help

9. Academic Connection:
	- help with student looking for post-graduate programs
- help with public sector alumni who want to connect with university research via alumni connections.

10. Ticket-System: 
- any alumni or person or student can create a ticket, which will float around until it is picked up by someone. This may make it easier to monitor how long help requests take, etc. 

11. A CU-Guide Wiki
	


Overall Notes:
1. Security: 
Security is a big design factor. 


2. on costs and efficiency:
It should be possible to design an efficient and sustainable version of the system described here. A design that stores, records, and maintains a large and ever increasing amount of information could be a large and expensive undertaking with privacy concerns as well. It should be possible to build a still-effective version of the platform that focuses on making a connection rather than storing all of everyone's projects forever. A system that is essentially an updated connection graph-data-base (or some ensemble of databases) of people and projects where all that is stored are pointers to connect to the person or project. This might leverage other existing platforms such as foreverbuffs, linkedin, github repos for projects, notion, etc. 

In either case a concern may be privacy, however if all that is ever recorded is indirect and already public information such as linkedin or social media contacts, hosted projects, outside landing pages, etc., it may be possible to vastly reduce that amount of private information aside from the names of the people and projects themselves (though in theory that too could be entirely redirected to other publicly posted material such as linkedin, github, etc.)

Search & AI
One area that may not already have been accomplished by Forever Buffs (nearly everything else may be) is a system to search and navigate all the alumni resources. 

This 'search' system could be a structured, graph-db, or even vector-DB search of resources and (if they exist) alumni-profiles of what they are interested in contributing, what projects exist, what wiki-resources exist, etc. 

There are also a spectrum of AI related options that range from a natural-language text search bar to a trained and data-retrieving AI-bot that helps to find people, projects and information in the possibly large set of information and categories of types of resources and options.

Connection-pointers could also have optional sunset-clauses where unless the pointers are refreshed by someone they will disappear, so out-of-date information does not become a problem.
